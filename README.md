## **About Services**
### [planboard-api](https://github.com/lynxiox/planboard-api)

This service exposes a REST API for managing users and tasks, securing access with JWT-based authentication. It handles user registration, authentication, and task management, including creation, updates, deletion, and viewing.

### [planboard-email-sender](https://github.com/lynxiox/planboard-email-sender)

This service sends email notifications by listening for messages from Kafka, processing the data, and using Spring Mail to send the emails.

### [planboard-scheduler](https://github.com/lynxiox/planboard-scheduler)

This service schedules daily tasks, generates 24-hour task reports for all users, and sends them to a Kafka queue for processing by the email sender service.

### [planboard-frontend](https://github.com/lynxiox/planboard-frontend)

This service is a frontend application that interacts with planboard-api for task management and user operations.
